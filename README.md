  - Just choose from a list of music to play in the background
- Proper settings menu
  - Enable/disable wear feature
- Update TargetSDK to Marshmallow aka implement new permissions "feature"

##Android Wear
**It just Worksâ„¢**

In theory as long as a Wear device is paired it should receive updates and information.
I have tried my best to make it work with many Wear devices, but I only have the emulator to work with.
If there is anyone out there using that feature and something looks wrong let me know!

##Permissions Breakdown
- Record Audio - For recording your own sound to be played at the end of each round
- Vibrate - Used with the audio to alert you the round has finished
- Internet - Used for the crash reporting analytics
- Wake Lock - So the countdown will continue to be active if the screen is turned off
